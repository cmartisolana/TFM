# Reconstruction of Sea Surface Salinity from observations made by the SMOS satellite in the southwest Atlantic Ocean
Datasets, codes and outputs used in the Master's Thesis of the Master's Degree in Advanced Physics and Applied Mathematics at University of the Balearic Islands (UIB)
## Description
The aim of this work is to improve the SSS satellite observations ressolution using a Lagrangian reconstruction technique to detect mesoscale salinity fronts at the southwest region of the Atlantic Ocean. The validation of the reconstructed fields is made with termosalinograph in-situ data from oceanographic campaigns.
